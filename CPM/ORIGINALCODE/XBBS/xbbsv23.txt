     First a word on the program. This Message System uses high
memory locations for storing the users password and user number.
Also in hi memory the return flag is set for CP/M users that wish
to re-enter [XBBS]. This flag MUST be cleared by BYE in order for
a new user to log onto the system.

INSTALLATION:

     Step 1) Using DDT; obtain at least 7 bytes of free memory
             in hi ram. Write the first number down; ie location
             FA10=NOP.

     Steð 2© Loaä thå basiã codå usinç MBASIÃ 5.² oò WÓ oò VEDIT.
             Locatå thå equate at the top of the program -> RT
             This is where you'll make your first change. Place
             RT; the hé  memorù locatioî that you wrote down.
             Iô  shoulä looë likå thisº RT=&HFA10. The rest of
             the memory equates will set themselves.

             The line should then look like this:

             RT=&HFA10:RT1=(RT+1):RT2=(RT+6)

     Step 3) System access and passwords.
             a) SYS1$ place your first and last name here.
             b) P1$ place quick CP/M access password here.
                1) Any length may be used, it P1$="ABCDEFGHI"
             c) P2$ place your sysop password here.
                1) SYSOP MUST be first followed by the pw. ie:
                   P2$="ABCDEFGHI"
             d) P3$ Currently set to NOPASS. If CP/M access by
                password is desired, replace NOPASS with the
                desired password that you will give users. ie:
                P3$="ABCDEFGHI" (any length)
             e) P4$ MUST be 6 characters long. This is your
                password that is entered into messages from you
                to ALL or a named person. This protects msgs from
                deletion by any other person but you. ie:
                P4$="ABCDEF" Remember 6 is SIX; not 4 or 8 but 6.

             the [XBBS] v2.2 must remain in place.

     Now you are ALMOST ready to compile the program. You still
have 2 things left to do.

          1) Remove the remark statement from the line at the top
             that reads: 'USER%=0:CALL USER(USER%)
             note: If your system user call is USR replace CALL
             USER with CALL USR.

             this documentation. If you saw it you either didn't
             read this or you forgot to take it out. In any case
             it MUST be removed.

     Now save your modified program in ASCII. ie:
                     SAVE"XBBSV23.BAS",A

COMPILING:

             incorporatinç the XBBSUSER.REL file (supplied).
             note:
               This file forces the system to always look at user
               area 0 regardless of what user area you are on for
               the user list; counters and associated files.


             Your command line for linking (assuming all pgms.
             for linking are on your A>) should look like this.

                 A>L80 XBBSV23,XBBSUSER,OBSLIB/S,XBBS/N/E

           You will now have a running COM file of the program.

BYE MODIFICATIONS:


    You must have your BYE program clear the $ that was put into
    RT as the return flag.

      Step 1) In the general equate area, add 1 more.
              RTFLG  EQU  0FA10H (your memory location).

      Step 2) Find out where BYE clears the option flags.
                  In BYE2 and MBYE-33 it's at label START2.
                  The area should look something like this:

                  START2:
                         XRA   A
                         STA   OPTION   ;clear options

                  Alì yoõ neeä dï ió tï adä ouò returî flaç equ
                  to that area. ie:

                  START2:
                         XRA   A
                         STA   OPTION   ;clear options
                         STA   RTFLG    ;clear XBBS return flag.


     This MUST be done in order to allow a new user to log in, else
[XBBS] will continue to welcome back the same user forever.

      That is all there is to the Installation of the program!.

At the command line you have the following added options. L,Z,P,D,Q.

          L= List todays callers. (erase each day)
          Z= List comments file. (erase each day)
          P= Change a users password. You do this by request or
             to LOCK out a user. Pick a 6 character password that
             you want to use as a lock out key. When you get a
             twit to log on; change his password to your selected
             password to prevent him from logging in.

          D= Date function. You must enter the date as 10-DEC-84
             This is a manual date function and again the utility
             makes use of the date in THAT style to purge users.

	  Q= List the xmodem.log (on A: user area 0)

     Functions: P,U,B,R,E

          P= Purge the message and summary files.
          U= Purge the user file.
             This should be done once a month. Users that don't
             call back in 30 days will be deleted and the file
             packed. Users that have been locked out will be
             deleted as well. After 3 or 4 times of use, all
             of your frequent callers will be at the top of the
             list and there user number will not change. Upon
             use; post a bulletin that the list has been purged
             anä tï receivå therå ne÷ numbeò, log on with there
             first and last name. A minor inconvinence for fast
             log on's.

          B= Build a summary file from the message file.
             This should only be used in the event that your
             summary file gets trashed. You will use the P
             function more than you'll use this one.

          R= Reset your counters.

          E= Exit to CP/M
